\section{\scshape Introduction}
\subsection{Background and Motivation}
\begin{frame}{Background and Motivation}
\begin{itemize}

\item Opinion Formation (e.g. voter models) is a common and very fundamental problem in the social sciences

\item Goal: Modelling the \emph{co}evolution of both opinions and the underlying social network

\item \textbf{Does our social network shape the opinion we hold or does our opinion determine who is part of our network?}
\item Preview: Analogies to statistical physics, e.g. \emph{phase transitions} can be identified


\vspace{0.2in}

\item "Opinion" must be mutually exclusive and "non-spectral", e.g. brand preference, religious views...

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{\scshape The Model}

\subsection{Initial Setup}
\begin{frame}{Initial Setup}
\begin{itemize}
\item Random graph with $N$ nodes (opinion holder) and $M$ edges (social connection)
%self-edges and multi-edges not allowed!
\item Random opinion $g_i \in G$ assigned to node $i$ 
%different opinions denoted by a set of subsequent integers given by $G$. BUT NO CONTINUUM! EACH OPINION EQUALLY LIKELY: no pair exists whose opinions are more similar than another pair.
\item Nodes exchange information (opinion) via undirected edges
\item Externally set parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item $N$ - number of nodes
\item $\gamma = \frac{N}{G}$ - average number of nodes per opinion
\item $k_{avg}=\frac{2M}{N}$ - average degree
\item $\Phi$ - reconnection probability
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Time Evolution Algorithm}
\begin{frame}{Time Evolution Algorithm}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Pick a random node $i$ with opinion $g_i$.  
\item (\textbf{a}) With probability $\Phi$ select at random one of the nodes $j$ that $i$ is connected to.
\begin{itemize}
\item If $g_i = g_j$, start over at step 1.
\item Otherwise, reconnect to a randomly chosen $j'$ of same opinion, i.e. $g_{j'} = g_i$.
\end{itemize}
\item (\textbf{b}) Otherwise, with probability $1-\Phi$ randomly select one of the neighboring vertices $j$ and change $g_i$ to $g_j$.
\item Repeat until \emph{consensus state} is achieved.
\end{enumerate}

\section{\scshape Results}

\subsection{Cluster Size Distribution}
%Effect of different reconnection probabilities on different consensus states. Outline two intuitive, extreme scenarious first! Then quantitative treatment.
%Explain static picture first: 
	%Consensus state of particular PHI (N=..., Runs=200)
	%Normalized histogramm of cluster size s => P(s) (s€[1,N])
	%Explain first extreme scenario in detail (powlaw, gap, giantclust, 	     order phase)
%Explain last static picture:
	%Biggest cluster only 10%, smax=gamma, integer/zerobound=>Poisson

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Cluster Size Distribution}
\begin{itemize}
\item Ordered phase
\begin{itemize}
\item Low $\Phi$, i.e. tendency to change opinion
\item Small clusters follow power law distribution
\item Existence of giant cluster
\end{itemize}
\item Unordered phase
\begin{itemize}
\item High $\Phi$, i.e. tendency to keep opinion
\item Clusters follow Poisson-like distribution
\item No giant cluster!
\end{itemize}
\item Phase transition
\begin{itemize}
\item First guess: $\Phi_c = 0.39 \pm 0.05$
\item Power law behavior over the whole $s$-range
\item Order parameter $S=\frac{s_{max}}{N}$
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Phase Transition and Critical Point}

\begin{frame}{Phase Transition \& Critical Point}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{Graphics/SvsPHI_combined.pdf}
\end{center}

\begin{itemize}
\item Really continuous phase transition
\item Bigger $N \rightarrow$ more dramatic transition
%Trend: steeper slope (more dramatic) for systems closer N-->inf (td limit)
\item $\Phi_c = 0.32 \pm 0.02$ independent of system size $N$
\item Weak agreement with $\Phi_c = 0.39 \pm 0.05$
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Convergence Time}
\begin{frame}{Convergence Time}

\begin{itemize}
\item Iterations per node to reach consensus as function of $\Phi$:
\item "Divergence" at some $\Phi_c$ for different $N$
\item Similar to divergent response functions in physics
\item Supporting phase transition interpretation, but difficult to find direct analogy to $\tau_{avg}$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparisons to Empirical Data}
\begin{frame}{Comparisons to Empirical Data}

\begin{itemize}

\item Idea: Compare distributions of some "opinion" in real world to the model $\rightarrow$ identify and interpret corresponding $\Phi$

\vspace{0.1in}

\item \textbf{Religion:}
\item Worldwide distribution of religions follows power law: Neither adaptation nor reconnection dominate in the formation?




\begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{Graphics/religion_power_law.pdf}
\end{figure}

\item Interpret $\Phi$ as an "intolerance indicator"?

\begin{frame}{Comparisons to Empirical Data}

\begin{itemize}


\item \textbf{Mobile Web Browsers:}
\item An example for opinion = brand preference
\item Contrast between giant cluster and "softer" distribution
\item Note: Plot is not a cluster size histogram!

\section{\scshape Conclusion}

\subsection{Summary}

\begin{frame}{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
\item Interdependent evolution of opinions and networks, combining two mechanisms of adaption and reconnection determined by $\Phi$
\item Holme's and Newman's \cite{main paper} work could be reproduced with more realistic assumptions %No self- and multi-edges. No affecting of local consensus states.
\item Continuous phase transition
\begin{itemize}
\item $N$-independent critical value $\Phi_c = 0.32 \pm 0.02$
\item Divergent consensus time at $\Phi_c$
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Outlook}
\begin{itemize}
\item Variation of $\gamma$ (diversity) and $k_{avg}$ (density)
%Main paper suggests k-dep but gamma-indep of Phi_c.
\item Include analogue of "magnetic field" in model: "$informed$ $ agents$"?
%Phase diagrams, better check of analogies
\item Make opinions $spectral$
\item More detailed comparisons to empirical data
\end{itemize}
