> Testing swarm models for different population sizes and influential neighbours

## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

Independent Variables: Number of influential neighbours, Population size
Dependent Variables: interaction forces (fish-fish, fish-env), Velocity & position -> spread of fish (population distribution)






(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

Neighbourhood: maximum distances of influential neighbours as a fraction of swarm spread.

Change in behaviour with respect to different neighbourhoods?

(Spread function is the smallest area that all fishes can fit in.)
-Cohesiveness of swarm in absence of objects. (Cohesiveness: 1/A, where A is the area of the smallest circle around the swarm)
-Splitting characteristics of swarm in presence of objects. (object: obstecle or food)
-Single/multiple objects.




(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

Increase of cohesiveness for increase neibhbourhood.
Increased chance of splitting up in presence of objects with increase of neighbourhood. 
For different population sizes, the product of cohesiveness and population (1/densitiy) should be constant for constant neighbourhood.

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)
