> * Project Title: Modelling Contagion in a Core-Periphery Financial Network

## General Introduction

Especially after the collapse of Lehman in 2008 researchers and policy
makers have shifted their focus towards the interconnectedness of
financial intermediaries regarding interbank lending. It has been shown that the default of a bank
can trigger other banks' failure via the network structure. Since then global discussions regarding
capital requirements and banking regulations have emerged, i.e. Basel III, Volcker Rule, Liikanen
report, UK Whitebook. All these measures aim to decrease the
probability of default of banks and hence, to reduce contagion
w.r.t. financial distress.
