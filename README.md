## General Introduction
Traffic jams are a growing problem in everyday life. Increasing road surface is not a sustainable solution to the problem as we are already reaching our limits in this respect. Also, building broader and broader roads is not compatible with environmental efforts. Therefore, we must try to increase the throughput using the existing infrastructure.

After a suggestion by Dr. Sanders we want to introduce a percentage of cars that act as guides. In practice these could be realized as self-driving cars which can communicate with each other.

## The Model
We want to model the human drivers using the "Intelligent Driver Model". This model takes into account the velocity of an individual car, the velocity of the car in front as well as the distance between both cars.

The guide cars are modelled so that they hold a moderate pace without sudden brakes. This can be accomplished by communication between the guide cars to allow early reaction to a perturbation.

## Fundamental Questions
* How many cars would have to act as guide cars in order to acheive a significant improvement in traffic flow during and after a disruption (e.g. an accident) occurs?

## Expected Results
We expect that a small portion of guide cars can make a comparatively large positive impact on traffic congestions.
