# CODE

> * MATLAB

## Next goal:
Write the first program that works.

## To-Do:
(1) Think about sensible functions for mu
(2) Think about sensible functions for kappa and implement it
--> What is about symmetry? You can implement smt and then we gonna discuss how much sense it makes ;)
(3) Put the code in the correct form (tabs and syntax in general)
(4) Finish the code
(4.1) Are the last lines sensible?
(4.2) Create bins and the plot function for a first visualisation of the opinion.

## Goals afterwards:
(1) Answer question 1 when playing with the program
(2) Implement nice visualizations
(3) Answer question 2 (optional)
(4) Answer question 3 (optional)
